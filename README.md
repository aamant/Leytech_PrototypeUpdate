## Update Prototype JavaScript library for Magento 1
A Magento 1 extension to cleanly update the Prototype Javascript library to 1.7.2 (or other versions).

### Features

- Provides an admin option to cleanly update the Prototype library to version 1.7.1, 1.7.2 or 1.7.3
- Does not affect the load order of Javascript resources so Prototype still loads first
- Does not require any layout XML updates
- Does not rewrite any core blocks or models
- Cleanly coded to avoid conflicts with other extensions

### Compatibility

Tested on Magento CE 1.9.3.x. Should work on lower versions ( >= 1.7) and equivalent EE. 

### How to use?

1. Enable the extension under System -> Configuration -> Leytech Extensions.
2. Select the desired Prototype version.
3. Refresh caches and test.

### Screenshots
